## ⚙Tech Stack  

- **React:** A popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.

- **React Router v7:** The go-to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—with a smooth upgrade path from v6.

- **Puter.com:** An advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, fast, and highly extensible. It can be used as a privacy-first personal cloud to keep all your files, apps, and games in one secure place, accessible from anywhere.

- **Puter.js:** A tiny client-side SDK that adds serverless authentication, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) directly into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection—ideal for building large-scale applications.

- **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server using native ES modules for instant startup, hot-module replacement, and Rollup-powered production builds—perfect for modern web development.

- **Zustand:** A minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
